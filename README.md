# ML-Based Prediction of Mechanical Properties of Fly Ash Concrete

This repository provides an overview of our research project focused on predicting **compressive strength** and **weight loss percentage** in fly ash concrete exposed to high temperatures, using machine learning techniques.

> 📢 _This work is currently under review and will be published soon._

## 🧠 Summary

The study is based on experimental data from 1,127 concrete specimens with varied fly ash content (0%–30%) and thermal exposure (ambient to 1000°C). A range of supervised machine learning models were evaluated.

### 🔢 Model Performance of a few models we applied- (R² Score)

| Model                            | Compressive Strength | Weight Loss % |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **CatBoost Regressor**           | 0.9963               | 0.9991        |
| **Generalized Additive Model**   | 0.9569               | 0.9992        |
| **Gaussian Process Regression**  | 0.9729               | 0.9858        |
| **Linear Regression**            | 0.8676               | 0.9621        |
| **ElasticNet**                   | 0.7422               | 0.7782        |

CatBoost achieved the highest accuracy for both targets.
